My app:

# Campus Buzz

I am a sophmore entering my junior year as of June 17th and I am learning Swift & SwiftUi for the first time. To me it's been an extremely confusing journey but I've managed to figure it out quite a bit. It's a fun language but some of it really perplexes me. This is the first version of my application that allows users to host events and sell tickets for other users to purchase. I am in no way a good designer so my app is not the prettiest.
